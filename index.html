          <li>
            <h3>Find The Right sport</h3>
            <p>Look for rivers, lakes, or streams with deep water and natural cover like rocks or plants. Early morning or late afternoon are the best times to fish in the wild.</p>
            <br />
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Choose Strong Gear</h3>
            <p>Use a sturdy rod and reel, as wild fish can be larger. Bring bait that mimics local food like worms or insects, and carry different types of lures to try.</p>
            <br />
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Know The Fish and Environment</h3>
            <p>Learn about the fish in the area, their habits, and the best times to catch them. Pay attention to weather and water conditions to improve your chances.</p>
            <br />
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Use Basic Survival Fishing</h3>
            <p>Be ready for the unexpected by knowing how to fish with minimal gear. Always bring essentials like a knife, extra line, and survival tools for emergencies.</p>
            <br />
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Respect Nature</h3>
            <p>Follow local fishing rules, practice catch-and-release when needed, and keep the environment clean. Take only what you need and leave the area as you found it.</p>
            <br />
          </li>
        </ol>

      <div class="text3">
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h3>Fishing Rod and Reel</h3>
            <p>A durable, medium to heavy-duty fishing rod and reel combo is essential for handling larger, wild fish.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Fishing Line</h3>
            <p>Bring extra fishing line, preferably strong, abrasion-resistant types, as it can easily get damaged in rugged environments.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Hooks and Lures</h3>
            <p>Carry a variety of hooks and lures that mimic local prey, like worms or small fish, to attract different species.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Bait</h3>
            <p>Natural bait, such as worms or insects, works well in the wild. If possible, gather bait from the environment to match what fish are used to eating.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Multi-tool or Knife</h3>
            <p>A multi-tool or knife is essential for cutting lines, removing hooks, and general outdoor survival tasks.</p>
